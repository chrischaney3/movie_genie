# The Movie Genie Web Application
## Overview:
Movie Genie is a movie recommendation web app designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on users' preferences. With a vast database of movies spanning different genres and eras, our app aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by offering relevant and curated recommendations. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Movie Genie analyzes user preferences, viewing history, and user-generated ratings to generate accurate and tailored movie suggestions.
## Instructions:
Create a machine learning algorithm for recommending personalized movie suggestions based on movie preferences.
  - Clean the data: Ensure the data used for training the model is clean and well-structured.
  - Process the data: Transform and preprocess the data to prepare it for training the machine learning model.
  - Create the Vector Algorithm: Develop an algorithm that can represent user preferences and movie features as vectors for efficient computation.
  - Train the model: Utilize the processed data to train the machine learning model that will generate movie recommendations.
  - Finalizing the topic: Refine the topic and scope of the project, ensuring it aligns with the objectives of Movie Genie.
  - Coming up with the possible data source: Identify potential data sources such as Kaggle or IMDb for gathering movie-related information.
